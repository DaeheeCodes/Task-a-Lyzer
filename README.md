## Mission

#### Ultimately, I want to level the playing for lower-income famillies and children when it comes to their accessibility to education / cutting-edge technology so that they are familliar with handling these techs at an early age.


I saw that iPhones did not support split-screen functionality out-of-box. I wanted to create an app that will allow lower-income famillies to use their single iOS device as a full-feature learning tool.<br/><br/>
Task-a-Lyzer achieves this by enabling dual-screen browsing and note-taking on iPhones.<br/><br/>
It has a full feature web-browser on the top screen and in-app note taking screen and iCloud Notes app on the bottom screen.<br/><br/>
Now anyone with a phone and a keyboard can use their iPhones as a full-feature learning device.


## Description
The application is developed/published/supported through it's entire life-cycle and is available to anyone to download for free on the App-Store.


## Installation

Can be downloaded on any iOS device on the Apple's App Store.
