## Mission

#### Ultimately, I want to level the playing for lower-income famillies and children when it comes to their accessibility to education / cutting-edge technology so that they are familliar with handling these techs at an early age.

Over 54% of the world population is still without a computer in their household while 84% of people have a personal smartphone.


Task-a-Lyzer attempts to bridge the equipment-gap for iOS based learning for people without personal computers or multiple iOS devices by providing them a frictionlesss support for split-screen learning on their single iOS device. While allowing them to familiarize themselves with using a mobile device for productivity - as pen and paper becomes more antiquated every year.


Currently, iPhones do not support split-screen natively and iPads do not support top-down multiscreen view. Users do not have an option to do two things at once natively on iPhones, Task-a-Lyzer changes that.


The app is also useful to users who are on-the-go and have a need to write down notes while reading the news, watching the market, etc.


## Description
The application is developed/published/supported through it's entire life-cycle and is available to anyone to download for free on the App-Store.


## Installation

Can be downloaded on any iOS device on the Apple's App Store.
